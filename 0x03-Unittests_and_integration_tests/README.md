# 0x03. Unittests and Integration Tests

This project focuses on writing unit and integration tests for Python applications, specifically for a GitHub organization client. It covers:

- **Unit Testing**: Writing tests for individual functions and methods.
- **Parameterization**: Using `parameterized.expand` for multiple test inputs.
- **Mocking**: Using `unittest.mock.patch` to isolate code during testing, including mocking HTTP calls and properties.
- **Memoization**: Understanding and testing memoized functions.
- **Integration Testing**: Testing components together, using fixtures to simulate external dependencies.

## Requirements

- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.7).
- All files should end with a new line.
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory.
- Code should use the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.5).
- All files must be executable.
- All modules, classes, and functions must have comprehensive documentation (docstrings).
- All functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.
